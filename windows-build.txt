Building cgminer on Windows 10
------------------------------

One way to build cgminer on Windows 10 is to use
 WSL - Windows Subsystem for Linux

Install WSL:

Either google 'WSL Ubuntu' or visit the Microsft store to download it for free:
 https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NBLGGH4MSV6
The 'Get' link will open the 'Microsoft Store' app on your Windows 10 computer
If the above link has changed, go to https://ubuntu.com/wsl to get the link

This will allow you to install WSL for Ubuntu

After installing WSL, make sure to enable WSL under 'Windows Features'
 - search 'Turn Windows Feaures on' using the windows search bar, at the bottom
 left, to find the 'Turn Windows features on or off' control panel
In the control panel, scroll down and click on the check box
 'Windows Subsystem for Linux' to enable it, then on OK
Windows may get some updates then require you to restart for the updates

Once the computer update/restart has completed:
Open a 'PowerShell' terminal as administrator.
 You can do this by typing powershell in the windows search bar.
 This should list various items including 'Windows PowerShell App' at the top.
 Right click on it and select 'Run as administrator'

In the PowerShell type:
 wsl --install -d Ubuntu-22.04

 N.B. there are problems with Ubuntu-24.04 so don't use 24.04, just use 22.04

Once the computer updates have completed you will find a 'Ubuntu' option
 in the windows menu.
If it hasn't already started, click on this to install Ubuntu
 When it's ready, be sure to give it a username and password you can remember.

Now you will have a Ubuntu terminal login that you can run at any time
 using the above 'Ubuntu' menu option in the windows menu.

How to cross compile cgminer using MXE on WSL or linux
------------------------------------------------------

** Commands require internet access to download software

** See the end for information about rebooting
**  and upgrading your Ubuntu to a later release if required
**  or you can just uninstall any Ubuntu you've already installed
**  and start again to get Ubuntu-22.04

** Normaly just do the following:

** In Ubuntu, issue the following commands:
 sudo apt update

** Update ubuntu packages with any recent updates:
 sudo apt upgrade -y

** Reboot now
 wsl.exe --terminate $WSL_DISTRO_NAME

** Start Ubuntu again from the Windows Start Menu

** To check what version of Ubuntu you are running:
 cat /etc/lsb-release
** It should be 22.04 with another number after it e.g. 22.04.5

** The steps below and mxe.sh work on Ubuntu 22.04 as at 2025-07

** Install git that we use to download some of the required code.
** It may already be installed:
 sudo apt install git

** Download cgminer - but don't build it yet:
 cd
 git clone https://github.com/kanoi/cgminer.git
 cd cgminer/

** There is a script in the cgminer directory called mxe.sh
** This script is used to type some of the long commands required.
** To see what mxe.sh does just type: cat mxe.sh
** It is designed specifically for Ubuntu
** If it needs updating, raise an issue on https://github.com/kanoi/cgminer
** You can of course type the commands yourself and modify them as needed

** The next command will install all the extra linux software needed.
** It downloads each package it requires:
 sudo ./mxe.sh a

** Download MXE and build the libraries cgminer needs:
 cd
 cgminer/mxe.sh mxe
 cd mxe/

** This compiles the mxe code needed - it can take a few hours in WSL ...
** It also downloads each package it needs to build:
 ../cgminer/mxe.sh b

** Build cgminer:
 cd
 cd cgminer/
 autoreconf -fi

** Next you must decide what miners you need to support - select as few as
**  possible e.g. to select just the Gekko and Icarus USB miners:
 ./mxe.sh c --enable-gekko --enable-icarus
** If instead you wish to build a debug version of cgminer use:
 ./mxe.sh d --enable-gekko --enable-icarus

** Then finally build cgminer:
 ./mxe.sh make

** Copy cgminer to your desktop (replace YourUser with your windows username):
 cp -v cgminer.exe /mnt/c/Users/YourUser/Desktop/

** See README for the setup of Zadig for all USB miners on windows

** To run cgminer, open a cmd window then type:
 cd Desktop
** See README for how to run cgminer.exe

------------------------------

If you wish to reset the WSL Ubuntu system you created so it will start again
from scratch next time you run it:

Close all your Ubuntu windows, right-click the windows menu 'Ubuntu' app,
select More->App Settings, then in the settings window use the 'Reset' button.

------------------------------

If Ubuntu ever requires a reboot, in the ubuntu window shutdown ubuntu with:

 wsl.exe --terminate $WSL_DISTRO_NAME

When you next start Ubuntu from windows it will be the same as a reboot

------------------------------

To check what release of Ubuntu you are running:

 cat /etc/lsb-release

To upgrade the Ubuntu release e.g. from v20.04 to v22.04
you must first update it fully and reboot:

 sudo apt update
 sudo apt upgrade -y
 wsl.exe --terminate $WSL_DISTRO_NAME

Next after restarting, to do a release upgrade:

 sudo do-release-upgrade
